## Modelation
### Cuboids
- [ ] 1xNxM
- [ ] 2x2x(2k + 1), k = 1, 2, 3, ...

### Notes
- 1xNxM puzzles are just flat with 180deg turns only.
- 2x2x(2k + 1) does not shape shift and they have 180deg turns except for the 2x2 slices (90deg).
- 2x2x(2k) have a 2x2 core and every piece sticks to that core. That way it can shape shift but they are like a 2x2 with extended pieces.

## Database
- [ ] Add adaptors for NeDB, localStorage and IndexedDB.

## Statistics
- [ ] Correlation between time and day
- [ ] Correlation between time and hour

## Bugs
- [ ] Fix F2L 8
